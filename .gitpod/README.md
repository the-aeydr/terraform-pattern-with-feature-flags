# GitPod Repository Configuration

[![Open in Gitpod](./assets/badge.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/theaeydr/terraform-pattern-with-feature-flags)

A **Gitpod** environment is a running container with a well-defined tool and runtime stack, along with its prerequisites. You can try out development containers using **[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)** or **[VS Code Desktop](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode)**.

This folder contains the Docker configuration for the development container used by this repository, while the Gitpod-specific configuration is located at the repository root in the `/.gitpod.yml` file.

> **Note:** If you already have a development container set up, you can skip ahead to working with the repository.
