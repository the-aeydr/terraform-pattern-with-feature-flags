A development container is a running container with a well-defined tool and runtime stack, along with its prerequisites. This folder contains configuration files for the development container used by this repository.

The development container is compatible with **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** and **[Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**.

> **Note:** If you already have a Codespace or dev container set up, you can begin working with the repository immediately.

For more information, refer to the upstream documentation on [creating a Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace), or follow the [getting started guide](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) for using the VS Code Dev Containers extension locally.

> **Important:** Any credentials available to you locally are likely not accessible inside the development container. You will need to authenticate within the container to access external services.
