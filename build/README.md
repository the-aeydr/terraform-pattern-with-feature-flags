# Makefile Build Library

The `build/` directory contains a collection of Makefile libraries organized to support common build operations across the repository. These files are designed to be modular and composable, allowing for reusable build logic that can be shared across different projects or CI/CD workflows.

This structure provides a consistent interface for integrating with continuous integration systems such as GitHub Actions, Codefresh, Travis CI, CircleCI, and Jenkins.
